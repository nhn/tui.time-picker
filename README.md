## Collect statistics on the use of open source
 TOAST UI time-picker applies Google Analytics (GA) to collect statistics on the use of open source, in order to identify how widely TOAST UI time-picker is used throughout the world.
It also serves as important index to determine the future course of projects.
`location.hostname` (e.g. > “ui.toast.com") is to be collected and the sole purpose is nothing but to measure statistics on the usage.
 To disable GA, use the following `usageStatistics` option when creating the instance.

```js
var options = {
    ...
    usageStatistics: false
}

var instance = new TimePicker(container, options);
```

 Or, include [`tui-code-snippet`](https://github.com/nhnent/tui.code-snippet)(**v1.5.0** or **later**) and then immediately write the options as follows:

```js
tui.usageStatistics = false;
```

```

If you want to use a specific version, use the tag name instead of `latest` in the url's path.

``` javascript
var TimePicker = tui.TimePicker;
```

#### Using module format in node environment
``` javascript
var TimePicker = require('tui-time-picker'); /* CommonJS */
```

``` javascript
import TimePicker from 'tui-time-picker'; /* ES6 */
```

``` javascript
var container = document.getElementById('tui-time-picker-container');
var instance = new TimePicker(container, { ... });
